#Iris_Flower_Classfication

This project is part of the Data Science internship at Yhills. It involves building a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and deployment.
## Project Steps
### Data Preprocessing:

+ Load the Iris dataset and inspect its structure.
+ Remove unnecessary columns, such as an ID column, that do not contribute to the classification task.
+ Perform any necessary data cleaning or handling of missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

+ Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
+ Use plots, such as scatter plots, histograms, or box plots, to understand the distributions and characteristics of each feature.
+ Analyze any correlations or patterns in the data.
+ Gain insights into the Iris flower species and their distinguishing features.
### Data Splitting:

+ Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
+ The training set will be used to train the machine learning models, while the testing set will be used for evaluating their performance.

### Model Training:

+ Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks.
+ Train each model using the training data.
+ Tune hyperparameters, if necessary, using techniques like cross-validation or grid search.

### Model Evaluation:

+ Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.
+ Calculate relevant evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall to assess the performance of each model.
+ Compare the models and identify the best-performing one for further use.
